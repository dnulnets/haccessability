#Accessability database and portal
This is a simple prototype for the Swedish IoT Hub for Accessability that allows you to manually and automatically through IoT accessability enabled devices enter information on geographical positions.

##Technology stack
The backend is developed in Haskell and uses the Yesod webframework and Morpheus graphQL library.

The portal is developed in Purescript and uses the declarative type-safe UI library Halogen.

It is planned to be able to build docker images for the database and backend server.

Please see README.md files in the subdirectories for more information.
